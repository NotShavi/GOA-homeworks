    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a
      >, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for
      CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a
      memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee
      specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
      That year, Berners-Lee and CERN

      engineer
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau"
        >Robert Cailliau</a
      >
      collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
      formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee
      listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
      encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]
